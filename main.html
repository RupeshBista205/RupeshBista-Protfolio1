    <h2> ABOUT ME</h2>
<p>
        My name is Rupesh Bista. I was born in Nepal on November1990.
        I had a very simple and happy childhood, and my only sibling, my younger Sister, would appear one year later after my own birth. Like my dad, I am introverted and am perfectly happy watching quality movies or using a personal computer during my spare time.

I started my working career as an intern at Tata Consultancy Service, Dallas Texas with the client Citi Group Technology. During my intern I got a chance to work on the Production Support role on one of the major applications of Citi Group.
